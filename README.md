# rosSpot - RouterOS Hotspot Billing & Voucher Management Platform
----

----

Original code written by [@ibnux](https://twitter.com/ibnux)

I've taken the code and rewritten quite a bit of it, especially the English translations. Some more work needs to be done, especially on the documentation side, and a lot of the install could be automated. It's also now functional. It's been a while since I've worked on this, so will need to rediscover how to install before documentation. 

I've simplified the required information to register, and added more relevant details so an e-mail address will be required to sign up, instead of a voucher code.
